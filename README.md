# Human Computer Interaction (HCI) – Assignment

This repository contains my HCI assignment work covering **Week 1 to Week 4**.  
The content is implemented using **simple, semantic HTML only**, following the scope and rules discussed in **Lab 01**.

---

##  Project Structure

The project is structured as a small static website:

- `index.html`  
  → Main landing page (home page)  
  → Provides an overview of the assignment and links to all weekly content  

- `Week-1-content.html`  
  → Week 1: Cognitive foundations & basic design principles  (STM Miller's Law and Interface Chuncking Observation)

- `Week-2-content.html`  
  → Week 2: Norman’s Action Cycle, gulfs of execution & evaluation  

- `Week-3and4-content.html`  
  → Weeks 3 & 4: Social interaction in HCI and cognitive models  
  → Includes conceptual comparison of **Norman, GOMS, and KLM**

- `html-practice-answers.html`  
  → Lab exam practice (HTML foundations)  
  → Covers semantic structure, accessibility, navigation, tables, and short answers  

- Image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`)  
  → Used across weekly pages for diagrams and examples  
  → All images are referenced using relative paths

---

##  Website Navigation

- The website opens from **`index.html`**
- Each week is placed on a **separate HTML page** for clarity
- Every content page includes a **“Back to Home”** link to return to `index.html`
- Navigation follows semantic HTML practices (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)

---

##  Accessibility & Semantic HTML

This assignment follows basic accessibility and semantic principles taught in class:

- Proper heading hierarchy (`h1` → `h2`)
- Semantic elements (`nav`, `main`, `section`, `table`, `footer`)
- Accessible tables using:
  - `<caption>`
  - `<th>` with `scope`
- Form examples use correctly associated `<label>` and controls
- Navigation uses meaningful link text

---

##  HCI Models Coverage

The content addresses the following HCI models as required:


- **Norman’s Seven Stages of Action**  
  → Used to analyze user goals, actions, feedback, and errors  

- **GOMS**  
  → Discussed conceptually for task structure and expert efficiency  

- **KLM (Keystroke-Level Model)**  
  → Explained at execution level for predicting expert, error-free performance  

The models are applied conceptually using real-world examples (e.g., expense sharing / “Who Paid?” problem).

##  Hosting (GitHub Pages)

- The repository is configured to deploy from the **main branch**
- `index.html` acts as the website entry point
